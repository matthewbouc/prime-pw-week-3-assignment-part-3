      <li>When discussing "for loops", is it common practice to reference the exact type of 'for loop'?
        Such as 'for of' vs 'for in' vs "for".
      </li>
        <ul>
          <li>Let's say I'm talking through my code in an interview. I talk through two sections, one a 'for in' loop
            and the other a "for of" loop. I reference them both as 'for' loops. Would the interviewer's
            first thought be, "This guy keeps calling all his 'for of' and 'for in' loops 'for' loops and it's bothering me more than his
            inconsistent use of quotation marks.  Single or double just pick one and stick to it!"
        </ul>
